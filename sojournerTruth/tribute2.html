        <p>
            Like many other historical figures <b>Sojourner Truth</b> has the courage
            to stand up for her beliefs no matter who agrees or disagrees. We should never let
            fear keep us from doing what matters most. The courage is what I admire most about Truth and the other historical figures. 
            There will always be someone who opposes what you stand for and even though you are not on the same page you should always hear that person out. 
            Someone like Truth who takes a stand shows a lot of leadership and bravery. Truth's actions motivated change 
            to happen for the better. Just by taking a brave stand for what you believe could have an influence 
            on others and make a difference in this world. Often I have to remind myself if I do 
            not speak up about what matters, attention would not be brung upon the matter. We have the right to express ourselves and state our personal opinions or ideas.
            That is why <mark>Freedom of Speech</mark> is such a big law today.

            Sojourner Truth was born into slavery. In 1826 Truth escaped slavery and helped lead other slaves to freedom using the Underground Railroad.
            She is most known for her <i>"Ain't I a Woman?"</i>speech delivered amid a lifetime of activism, 
            at the <i>Ohio Women's Rights Convention</i> in Akron, Ohio
            in May of 1851. Amongst other activists Truth made a stand to
            fight for equality in the United States of America. She has many other speeches about abolotionism and 
            equal rights for all. <strong>Truth pursued political equality for all
            women and spoke against other abolitionists for not pursuing 
            civil rights for all black men and women.</strong> For instance, her many contributions to the women's suffrage movement.
            She helped recruit black troops for the Union Army during the civil war.
